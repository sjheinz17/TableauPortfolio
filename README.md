### 🔍 Project Overview
This portfolio project demonstrates a full-cycle business analysis, ranging from financial forecasting to deep-dive retention strategies. The goal was to provide executive stakeholders with interactive tools to model profit scenarios and identify root causes of customer attrition.

The project is divided into **three distinct dashboards**:

---

### 1️⃣ Executive Sales Summary & Scenario Modeling
**Focus:** Financial Forecasting & Profitability

* **Scenario Modeling:** Built dynamic parameters allowing users to test "What-If" scenarios (e.g., *How does a 10% price increase impact total profit?*).
* **Profit Waterfall:** Visualized the running sum of profit month-over-month to identify critical growth periods.
* **Regional Performance:** Comparative analysis of sales volume between North and South regions.

### 2️⃣ Churn Drivers: Price Sensitivity Analysis
**Focus:** Risk Factors & Customer Behavior

* **The "Death Zone":** Identified that **31%** of customer churn occurs within the first 30 days, highlighting onboarding risks.
* **Correlation Analysis:** Utilized scatter plots with trend lines to prove the correlation between higher monthly bills and shorter customer tenure.
* **Trend Analysis:** Tracking churned customers by their last day of activity to spot seasonal exit patterns.

### 3️⃣ Retention Cohort & Regional Analysis
**Focus:** Long-term Retention & Geography

![Churn Dashboard Preview](Interactive%20Churn%20Dashboard.png)

* **Cohort Heat Map:** Implemented a triangular heat map to track specific customer cohorts over time, revealing a steep drop-off after Month 1.
* **Retention Curves:** plotted distinct retention lines for each region, exposing the **South Region** as a high-risk area with 100% churn in specific cohorts.
* **Geographic Variance:** Quantified churn rates by region (South: 100% vs East: 0%) to prioritize regional intervention.

### 🛠️ Technical Skills Applied

* **Advanced Calculations:** Used `DATEDIFF` to calculate customer tenure and `IF/THEN` logic to categorize churn status.
* **Statistical Analysis:** Implemented Trend Lines (Linear Regression) and Average Lines to benchmark performance against historical norms.
* **Dashboard Interactivity:** Built **"Filter Actions"** allowing stakeholders to click a data point (e.g., a specific customer dot) to drill down into a detailed row-level profile for that account.
* **Data Visualization:** Utilized Histograms for distribution analysis, Area Charts for time-series trending, and Scatter Plots for correlation analysis.
